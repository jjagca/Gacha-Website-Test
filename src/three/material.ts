/**
 * src/three/material.ts
 *
 * Contract: centralize creation/configuration of Three.js materials.
 *
 * Intended responsibilities:
 * - Provide factory helpers for materials used by the scene (e.g., character, environment, UI).
 * - Keep material configuration in one place to simplify tuning and swapping implementations.
 * - Optionally expose types/interfaces for material options shared across the app.
 *
 * Note: No material implementations are added yet (placeholders only).
